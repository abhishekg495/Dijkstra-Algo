# Dijkstra-Algo
This repo contains c++implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path (in graphs). It takes no. of nodes, no. of edges, and edges in the format (node1 node1 weight)
in that order and then prints the shortest path from node 1 to all other nodes. The code outputs and takes input according to 1-based indexing
